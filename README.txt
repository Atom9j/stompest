stomp, stomper, stompest!

Stompest is a no-nonsense STOMP implementation for Python including both a synchronous and a Twisted implementation.

Unlike other python STOMP implementations, the synchronous client does not assume anything about your concurrency model (thread vs process).  Modeled after the Perl Net::Stomp module, it mostly stays out of your way and lets you do what you want.

The Twisted client builds additional functionality on top of the stomper library to provide a full-featured client.
