stomp, stomper, stompest!
=========================

`stompest <https://github.com/nikipore/stompest/>`_ is a full-featured implementation of the `STOMP <http://stomp.github.com/>`_ protocol (versions `1.0 <http://stomp.github.com//stomp-specification-1.0.html>`_ and `1.1 <http://stomp.github.com//stomp-specification-1.1.html>`_) for Python 2.6 (and higher) including both synchronous and asynchronous clients:

* The synchronous client is dead simple. It does not assume anything about your concurrency model (thread vs process) or force you to use it any particular way. It gets out of your way and lets you do what you want.
* The asynchronous client is based on `Twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, a very mature and powerful asynchronous programming framework. It supports destination specific message and error handlers (with default "poison pill" error handling), concurrent message processing, graceful shutdown, and connect, receipt, and disconnect timeouts.

Both clients make use of a generic set of components in the each of which can be used independently to roll your own STOMP client:

* a wire-level STOMP frame parser and compiler,

* a faithful implementation of the syntax of the STOMP 1.0 and 1.1 protocols with a simple stateless function API,

* a generic implementation of the STOMP 1.0 and 1.1 session state semantics, such as protocol version negotiation at connect time, transaction and subscription handling (including a generic subscription replay scheme which may be used to reconstruct the session's subscription state after a forced disconnect),

* and a `failover transport <http://activemq.apache.org/failover-transport-reference.html>`_ URI scheme akin to the one used in ActiveMQ.

This module is thoroughly unit tested and (in version 1.x) production hardened for the functionality used by `Mozes <http://www.mozes.com/>`_ --- persistent queueing on `ActiveMQ <http://activemq.apache.org/>`_. The substantially redesigned stompest 2 is probably even better tested but should be considered (mature) alpha: Some features to come (in particular heartbeating and STOMP 1.2) may still require minor changes of the API.

The module is tested with Python 2.6 and 2.7, Twisted 11.0 and 12.0 (it should work with Twisted 10.1 and higher), and ActiveMQ 5.5.1, 5.6, and 5.7. The integration tests also pass against `RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_ 2.8.7 and `Apollo <http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/>`_ 1.5. All of these brokers were tested with STOMP protocols 1.0 and 1.1. Minor enhancements may be required to use this STOMP adapter with other brokers.

Acknowledgements
================
* Version 1.x of stompest was written by `Roger Hoover <http://github.com/theduderog/>`_ at `Mozes <http://www.mozes.com/>`_ and deployed in their production environment.
* Kudos to `Oisin Mulvihill <https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/>`_, the developer of `stomper <http://code.google.com/p/stomper/>`_! The idea of an abstract representation of the STOMP protocol lives on in stompest.
